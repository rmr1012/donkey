* [Slack / Chat](https://donkey-slackin.herokuapp.com/)

#### Use Donkey if you want to:
* Make an RC car drive its self.
* Compete in self driving races like [DIY Robocars](http://diyrobocars.com)
* Experiment with different driving methods.
* Add parts and sensors to your car.
* Log sensor data. (images, user inputs, sensor readings) 
* Drive your car via a web or game controler.
* Leverage community contributed driving data.

### Getting started. 
After building a Donkey2, here are the steps to start driving.

install donkey
```
git clone https://github.com/wroscoe/donkey donkeycar
pip install -e donkeycar
```

Create a car folder.
```
donkey createcar --path ~/d2
```

Start your car.
```
python ~/d2/manage.py drive
```

Now you can control your car by going to `<ip_address_of_your_pi>:8887/drive`
